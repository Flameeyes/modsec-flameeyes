# Checks for proxies and open proxies.
#
# Proxied requests will have either a Via or a X-Forwarded-For header
# added by the proxy itself; if it's found, register the IP as a proxy
# for the next week. Other checks might be implemented when coming
# through all kind of proxies.
#
# In either case, if not known already, check a list of DNSBL for open
# proxies (and other similar things like drones); keep the value
# cached for the next week, so to avoid further requests.
#
# Please note: all non-GET, non-HEAD requests will be scanned through
# DNSBL unless the IP is already marked as bad; to avoid resolving the
# same hostname each time, make sure to use a DNS cache (either
# through a caching nameserver or nscd as provided by GLIBC or
# FreeBSD).
