# Rules for validation of legit robots and crawlers (search engines
# and services).
#
# Most search engines and other services that make use of robots and
# crawlers provide a way to safely ensure that the request is really
# coming from them by using FcRDNS (Forward-confirmed Reverse
# DNS). This is done through the following steps:
#
#  - take the IP the request comes from, and do a reverse-DNS query
#    for it;
#  - compare the returned hostname against the valid hostname pattern
#    for the bot;
#  - confirm that the reverse DNS response is valid by ensuring that
#    the hostname resolution reports, at least once, the original IP
#    we started from.
#
# Thankfully, Apache already solves half the problem for us, if the
# following option is enabled:
#
#   HostnameLookups Double
#
# When this is enabled, the REMOTE_HOST variable will be set to the
# reverse DNS, but only if it's confirmed, otherwise it'll still
# report the IP address.
#
# The tests in this file make use of this feature, so if you don't
# want to do the double-resolution, you might want to remove it, or
# otherwise, add the directive as shown before.
#
# Note: if you still want to keep the same format in the log files,
# with IP rather than hostnames, you have to also change your
# CustomLog directive.
#
# As with the RBL checks, it is recommended to have a caching name
# server or NSCD service available to the server to reduce the latency
# on repeated requests.
