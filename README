This is a rule set for ModSecurity developed by Diego Elio Petten√≤.

The aim of this rule set is to reduce bandwidth waste on hosts that
might even be static by disallowing certain known marketing, broken or
abusive bots from hitting the site at all.

Evne if you do not pay for bandwidth and your website is not going to
suffer from the requests, keeping spammers and malicious crawlers at
bay is important for the general health of the Network, so please be
mindful.
